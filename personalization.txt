I chose these colors because they work well together. They make the website look more professional and not bursting with color. It makes the viewer more engaged in the website and they will intract with it more.

- How will this calendar help you stay organized? It will help me know the times of assignments due which is really helpful.
- What challenges did you face getting it set up? It was hard to find all of the links to paste, and it was just hard to follow.
